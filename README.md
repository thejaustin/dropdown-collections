# dropdown-collections
A WIP Firefox extension that modifies Simple Tab Groups to appear in a drop-down style.

## Note that this is very much a work in progress
I created a repo for this extension to share with friends and easily customize it. I'm hoping to use this repo to also automagically update the extension through GitHub (view MiniBlockMod repo for the deprecated rendition of this). I would absolutely love to make this my own and release it as public one day, but this will be after tons of bug squashing, so here we are!

## Currently there's nothing here
That's understood. I've created this repo as a placeholder so I'll force myself to get to work on this mini-project as it will improve my productivity a ton, especially if I tie it in with another secret AIO project. ;)
